  I am continually learning about software development, data science, and how
  to teach it. I spend my time meditating on content accessibility and more 
  factors that could affect how people learn virtually. Typography, colors,
  auditory elements, and more. Improving the experience of others is a first
  step to build a better place to learn. âœ¨
