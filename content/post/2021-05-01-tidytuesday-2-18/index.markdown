## CEO departures

The data this week comes from [Gentry et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3278) by way of [DataIsPlural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-04-21-edition/).

> We introduce an open‚Äêsource dataset documenting the reasons for CEO departure in S&P 1500 firms from 2000 through 2018. In our dataset, we code for various forms of voluntary and involuntary departure. We compare our dataset to three published datasets in the CEO succession literature to assess both the qualitative and quantitative differences among them and to explore how these differences impact empirical findings associated with the performance‚ÄêCEO dismissal relationship. The dataset includes eight different classifications for CEO turnover, a narrative description of each departure event, and links to sources used in constructing the narrative so that future researchers can validate or adapt the coding. The resulting data are available at (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4543893).
>
> This revision includes potentially relevant 8k filings from 270 days before and after the CEO‚Äôs departure date. These filings were not all useful for understanding the departure, but might be useful in general.

## General preprocessing

In particular, for this week of [\#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday),
I decided to focus on three main variables:

-   `fyear`: The fiscal year in which the event occurred.
-   `departure_code`: The departure reason coded.
    1.  Involuntary - CEO death
    2.  Involuntary - CEO illness
    3.  Involuntary - CEO dismissed for job performance
    4.  Involuntary - CEO dismissed for legal violations or concerns
    5.  Voluntary - CEO retired
    6.  Voluntary - New opportunity (new career driven succession)
    7.  Other
    8.  Missing
    9.  Execucomp error
-   `notes`: Long-form description and justification for the coding scheme assignment.

Although *death* and *illness* are correctly classified as involuntary departures,
departures due to job performance or violation of the law are, in general, the
product of the individual himself. Therefore, I decided to separate them. For
simplicity, I kept exit codes 3 and 4 as `Involuntary` and the rest as `Other`.

``` r
departures_processed <- departures %>%
  select(fyear, departure_code, notes) %>%
  filter(
      departure_code < 9,
      fyear > 1995,
      fyear < 2019
  ) %>%
  mutate(
      involuntary = if_else(
        condition = departure_code %in% 3:4,
        true = "Involuntary",
        false = "Other"
      ),
      departure_code = fct_recode(
        .f = factor(departure_code),
          "Death" = "1",
          "Illness" = "2",
          "Job performance" = "3",
          "Legal violations or concerns" = "4",
          "Retired" = "5",
          "New opportunity" = "6",
          "Other" = "7",
          "Missing" = "8"
      )
  ) %>%
  glimpse()
```

## Create custom credits for plots

Since I needed to generate multiple plots, I did not want to repeat myself and
decided to include the process of adding credits with my brand in one place.

{{% callout note %}}
The `load = JS(" ... ")` section is not necessary in certain places.
However, I decided to use it since in this blog the `iframes` that will be
generated will try to open content within itself and will throw a error.
In this way, I ensure that `target` is always a new tab. üßêüëâüëà
{{% /callout %}}

``` r
add_custom_credits <- function(hc) {
  hc_credits(
    hc = hc,
    text = "<b>Dataviz by:</b> @jvelezmagic",
    href = "https://twitter.com/jvelezmagic",
    enabled = TRUE
  ) %>%
    hc_chart(
      events = list(
        load = JS("
          function() {
            this.credits.element.onclick = function() {
              window.open('https://twitter.com/jvelezmagic', '__blank');
            }
          }
          "
        )
      )
    )
}
```

## CEOs departures

The first thing I wanted to find out was how the number of CEO exits changes over
time. In addition, I wanted to separate the counts into two main categories,
`Involuntary` and `Other`. Where involuntary would represent those CEOs who were
fired for reasons of job performance or for non-compliance with the law.

### Prepare data for plot

Using the tidyverse ecosystem, answering that question boils down to using the
`count()` function specifying the variables by which we want to group and count.

``` r
involuntary_departures <- departures_processed %>%
  count(fyear, involuntary) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 46
    ## Columns: 3
    ## $ fyear       <dbl> 1996, 1996, 1997, 1997, 1998, 1998, 1999, 1999, 2000, 2000‚Ä¶
    ## $ involuntary <chr> "Involuntary", "Other", "Involuntary", "Other", "Involunta‚Ä¶
    ## $ n           <int> 42, 273, 52, 274, 42, 305, 58, 332, 78, 286, 64, 165, 73, ‚Ä¶

### Create interactive line plot

Having our data ready, the next thing is to use `hchart()` to specify what type
of chart we want to obtain. In this case, a line graph, where each line
represents those CEO departures, either `involuntary` or for `other` reasons.

To help compare both groups I decided to add a shared tooltip between both lines
with `hc_tooltip()`.

To help put the data in context a bit, I decided to add a band along the X axis
representing the 2008 financial crisis by specifying the `plotBandas` attribute
within `hc_xAxis()`.

Finally I added the credits and used `frameWidget()` to allow me to display this
graphic within this static page. Inside a *Rmarkdown* or a *Shiny app* it might
not be necessary. üò¨

``` r
involuntary_departures %>%
  # Plot specifications -----------------------------------------------------
  hchart(
    type = "line",
    hcaes(x = fyear, y = n, group = involuntary),
    regression = TRUE
  ) %>%
  hc_add_dependency("plugins/highcharts-regression.js") %>% 
  hc_tooltip(
    crosshairs = TRUE,
    shared = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  # Text annotations --------------------------------------------------------
  hc_title(
    text = "CEOs departures"
  ) %>%
  hc_xAxis(
    title = list(text = "Year"),
    plotBands = list(
      list(
        label = list(
          text = "Global<br>crisis",
          style = list(
            color = "white",
            fontWeight = "bold"
          ),
          useHTML = TRUE
        ),
        color = "rgba(256,0,0,0.4)",
        fillOpacity = 0.5,
        from = 2006,
        to = 2008
      )
    )
  ) %>%
  hc_yAxis(
    title = list(text = "Number of CEOs departures")
  ) %>%
  # Credits -----------------------------------------------------------------
  add_custom_credits() %>%
  # Display as iframe -------------------------------------------------------

## Historical CEOs departures by category

I wondered how all CEOs are distributed collectively in the data by their
departure code. Here I had many display options, `bars`, `sunburst`, `treemap`,
among others.

Choosing a visualization that allows you to see exactly what you need without
worrying about the details is important. In my case, I just wanted to make
`treemaps` for fun, but I could make any other.

{{% callout note %}}
`treemaps` can be useful when:

-   You want to observe relationships among a large number of categories.
-   Precision in comparisons is not that important.
-   Your data is hierarchical.
    {{% /callout %}}

In my case, I did not consider precise comparisons between categories important
at this point in the data exploration. The `treemap` allowed me to quickly
determine how CEOs departures codes were distributed.

### Prepare data for plot

In order for `highcharter` to understand our data, we must transform it to a list
containing which objects are parents and which are children, which in javascript
could be a `JSON` or `dictionary`.

To solve this, `highcharter` provides `data_to_hierarchical()` shortcut that
allows you to directly obtain the format needed to create a `treemap` or a
`sunburst`. üòã‚ú®

``` r
departures_treemap_plot <- departures_processed %>%
  mutate(
    fyear = as.character(fyear),
    value = 1
  ) %>%
  data_to_hierarchical(
    group_vars = c(departure_code, fyear),
    size_var = value
  )

departures_treemap_plot[[100]] %>% 
  glimpse()
```

    ## List of 5
    ##  $ name  : chr "2018"
    ##  $ id    : chr "legal_violations_or_concerns_2018"
    ##  $ parent: chr "legal_violations_or_concerns"
    ##  $ value : num 8
    ##  $ level : int 2

### Create nested treemap

First I defined that the type of visualization I wanted was a `treemap`.

The global call to `dataLabels` says that, by default, don‚Äôt paint any labels in
sight. This will allow customizing the order of appearance of our labels in each
hierarchical layer.

Besides, I decided to add a bit of a separating border width between each
of my categories to make it more apparent where each one started and ended.

Parameter `allowDrillToNode` allows you to click on a point and access to the
next hierarchical level of the data. In our case, we only have two levels,
`departures_code` and `fyear`, but they could be more. ü§ì

``` r
# Plot specification --------------------------------------------------------
hchart(
  departures_treemap_plot,
  type = "treemap",
  ## Global configuration ---------------------------------------------------
  dataLabels = list(
    enabled = FALSE
  ),
  ## Modify levels appearance -----------------------------------------------
  allowDrillToNode = TRUE,
  levelIsConstant = FALSE,
  levels = list(
    list(
      level = 1,
      borderWidth = 4,
      dataLabels = list(
        enabled = TRUE,
        style = list(
          fontSize = "14px"
        )
      )
    ),
    list(
      level = 2,
      dataLabels = list(
        enabled = FALSE
      ),
      colorVariation = list(
        key = "brightness",
        to = 0.25
      )
    )
  )
) %>%
  # Text annotations --------------------------------------------------------
  hc_title(
    text = "CEOs departures by category"
  ) %>%
  # Credits -----------------------------------------------------------------
  add_custom_credits() %>%
  # Display as iframe -------------------------------------------------------
  frameWidget()
```

<div id="htmlwidget-2" style="width:100%;height:480px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2">{"x":{"url":"index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_treemap.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

## Why CEOs leave the company?

Once I learned how CEO departures were historically, I wondered why they had to
quit. What bad things did they do? What did they get sick from? Did they have
good recommendations to migrate to a better job?

To answer the questions, I decided to do some simple natural language processing
like data exploration, but this could be more complicated to get better results.
It all depends on what you want to achieve in the end. üßê

### Text processing

I decided to start by separating all the notes written about CEO exits to their
corresponding word form with `unnest_tokens()`. This generated me a new column
called `word`.

Sometimes when we write texts, not all words are important. Perhaps we could
focus on certain phrases ignoring, for example, articles, pronouns,
prepositions, etc.

`get_stopwords()` returns a tibble with two columns, `word` and `lexicon`,
where word represents the stop words of a language (by default English) and
lexicon as the source from which they were extracted. Since the our data and the
data generated by `get_stopwords()` contain the `word` column, I performed an
`anti_join()` of the tables to **remove** all those words that it did not require.

Following the same logic described above, I made an `inner_join()` to **keep**
only those words that were associated with some feeling given a lexicon.
This certainly narrowed my *corpus*, but for my mental question it worked to
filter my observations instead of taking the global tops.
Although, perhaps to build a model you might prefer to keep all the words and
use `ngrams`.

Finally, I counted the words by departure code. üò¥

``` r
departures_words <- departures_processed %>%
  select(departure_code, notes) %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = notes) %>%
  anti_join(y = get_stopwords()) %>%
  inner_join(y = get_sentiments(lexicon = "bing")) %>%
  count(departure_code, word) %>%
  glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 2,599
    ## Columns: 3
    ## $ departure_code <fct> Death, Death, Death, Death, Death, Death, Death, Death,‚Ä¶
    ## $ word           <chr> "absence", "affluence", "attack", "best", "cancer", "ce‚Ä¶
    ## $ n              <int> 1, 1, 6, 1, 11, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 1, 51, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1,‚Ä¶

### Prepare data for plot

I wanted to develop a word cloud where the first categories tell us how many words
associated with feelings we find per category. After clicking on any of these, I
wanted to show the word cloud of the words associated with those categories.

First, I used `group_nest()` to create a tibble with two columns,
`departure_code` and `data`. I added an `id` column that will be the one that
connects our charts by level. `type` column will tell `highcharter` that the
subplot I want is a word cloud as well.

The first call to `map()` corresponds to creating two new columns to the data of
our `data` column; `name` and `weight`, parameters described in the creation of
a `wordcloud` type chart. The second call to `map()` is to convert each tibble
into a highcharter-understandable list.

Finally, I counted how many words each category contained. It should be noted
that this new column `n` now exists both at the first and second levels, that is,
within `data`, therefore we can use it to customize our `tooltips` with a better
message. ü§´

``` r
departures_words_plot <- departures_words %>%
  group_nest(departure_code) %>%
  mutate(
    id = departure_code,
    type = "wordcloud",
    data = map(data, mutate, name = word, weight = log(n)),
    data = map(data, list_parse),
    n = lengths(data)
  ) %>%
  glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 8
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ departure_code <fct> Death, Illness, Job performance, Legal violations or co‚Ä¶
    ## $ data           <list> [["absence", 1, "absence", 0], ["affluence", 1, "afflu‚Ä¶
    ## $ id             <fct> Death, Illness, Job performance, Legal violations or co‚Ä¶
    ## $ type           <chr> "wordcloud", "wordcloud", "wordcloud", "wordcloud", "wo‚Ä¶
    ## $ n              <int> 54, 94, 790, 263, 686, 76, 602, 34

### Create interactive Word Cloud

First I defined that the type of chart I wanted was a `wordcloud`.
Then I specified which columns to take the data from, similar to creating a
graph with `ggplot2`. The `drilldown` parameter is who will say where to zoom to
our data. üòâ

With `hc_drilldown()` we will define the `series` or subplots that we want to
visualize. As you may have been imagining, we could add different levels with
different graphics, for example going from a representation of `bars` to one of
`lines` simply by configuring the formats of our series. ü§Ø

Finally I set up the texts of the figure, specifying that, when it will enter
the first level, the title will be updated and put the corresponding one for the
category. Just to keep us in context of which words are from which category.
On the other hand, I indicated that the `tooltip` will show the value of the
variable `n`, present at level 1 and 2 of the data. Therefore, despite displaying
the data on a logarithmic scale, we can display the absolute counts that are easier
to interpret. üò¨

``` r
departures_words_plot %>%
  # Plot specification ------------------------------------------------------
  ## First level ------------------------------------------------------------
  hchart(
    type = "wordcloud",
    name = "Categories",
    hcaes(

      drilldown = departure_code
    )
  ) %>%
