  I love analyzing and visualizing data to
  improve our understanding of what is around us. Besides, I am fascinated by
  software development, and I hope to contribute valuable packages to the
  scientific community one day. I am known for being a passionate, curious
  person and be always open to new challenges. Do you have any challenges?
  Good! Let’s do it. Let’s be problem solvers. 👨‍💻 🧐 🦉 ✨
