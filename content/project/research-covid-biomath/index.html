title: Biomaths in times of coronavirus
summary: |
  Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19),
  many mathematical models have been proposed, various of which several
  governments have used to implement their policies to lock down the
  population. In particular, Mexico City has posed for an ordinary
  differential equations model to control the spread of the virus. But,
  no optimal span of the lockdown was proposed, and therefore, the city is
  in an indefinite quarantine, affecting the whole country's economy.
