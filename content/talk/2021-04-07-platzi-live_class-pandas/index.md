title: Pandas and its ecosystem for data science
summary: Learn how to use pandas and the ecosystem constructed around it to build human-readable workflows.
---

## Abstract
I'm sure most of the people reading this have heard of pandas, one of the most
widely used python libraries for data science. In this talk we will see how
to use the ecosystem built around it to build human-readable workflows.
We will see from the exploratory analysis of data to the implementation of a
classification model of the survivors of the tragic event of the sinking of
the RMS Titanic. Join me and let's explore together!
